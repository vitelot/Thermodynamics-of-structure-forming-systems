# Montecarlo simulation of structure-forming systems

Structure-forming systems (SFS) are ubiquitous in nature, ranging from atoms building molecules
to self-assembly of colloidal amphibolic particles.
Here, we work out the scripts used in calculating the properties of SFS presented in the article [Thermodynamics of structure-forming systems][article] by J. Korbel et al.

We describe our method in the [supplementary information][supplementary] of the aforementioned article in the following figure:
