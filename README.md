# Montecarlo simulation of structure-forming systems

Structure-forming systems (SFS) are ubiquitous in nature, ranging from atoms building molecules to self-assembly of colloidal amphibolic particles.
Here, we present the Python scripts used in calculating the properties of SFS presented in the article [Thermodynamics of structure-forming systems][article] by J. Korbel et al. </br>

We also work out a fast multi-treading Julia version of the scripts in two different variants.
One variant considers macro variables only, such as magnetization and number of molecules, while the other variant follows the dynamics of single atoms.
More information can be found in the respective folders.
