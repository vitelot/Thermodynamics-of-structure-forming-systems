Structure-forming systems (SFS) are ubiquitous in nature, ranging from atoms building molecules
to self-assembly of colloidal amphibolic particles.
Here, we work out the scripts used in calculating the properties of SFS presented in the article <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21272-7">Thermodynamics of structure-forming systems<a> by J. Korbel et al.
